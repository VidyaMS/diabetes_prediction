In this repo , we perform the analysis for predicting the class 'positive' or 'negative for diabetes.   
Various models are checked for their classification performance and the best model is selected and saved.   
We also have a web based app to upload new data containing the same features as that in the original data source.  
Once uploaded, the data is classified for diabetes using the saved model.  
The prediction results are displayed on the web and the user is able to download the file with the probabilities for each case.
